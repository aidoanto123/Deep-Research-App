# 🧠 Deep Research

Deep Research is an AI-powered pipeline for automated web research, report generation, and email delivery.  
It leverages multiple specialized agents (planner, searcher, writer, and emailer) to turn a simple query into a **detailed, structured research report** — and even send it straight to your inbox.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive UI** powered by [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)  
- **Planner Agent** – breaks down queries into the most relevant web searches  
- **Search Agent** – performs concise web research summaries  
- **Writer Agent** – synthesizes search results into a **5–10 page markdown report**  
- **Email Agent** – formats and delivers the report as an HTML email  
- **Tracing & Debugging** with OpenAI’s tracing tools  
- Fully **async** architecture for faster research workflows
